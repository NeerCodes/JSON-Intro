# JSON-Intro

### **Introduction to JSON**

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data interchange format used for storing and transporting data.
- It's often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

### **JSON Sytnax**
- JSON data consists of name/value pairs, similar to JavaScrit object properties.
- A name/value pair includes a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon and the corresponding value.
- Unlike JavaScript, JSON names **requires double quotes**.

### **JSON Objects**
- JSON objects are enclosed in curly braces {}.
- Objects can contain multiple name/value pairs.

>>> data.json
```java
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}```
